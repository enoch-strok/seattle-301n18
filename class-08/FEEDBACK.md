## Week 3

### Yeah!

- Catharsis on Saturday was needed and felt great
- Inline comments in "Real Time" from Ray
- I really really like doing the group problem solving break outs as a form of code review.

### Meh...

- Due to the long chat, we went long
- Getting Help (the process)
- Getting (no) Help even when you're with someone ...

### Uh ... No.

- Lecture was seen as long / not all questions totally answered in context

### Adjustments and thoughts

- Will definitely be doing more inline comments
- Will definitely be doing a pre-demo overview/drawing/plan
- Shred Talk style short videos will be tough to put together on short notice, but we'll see what we can do
- TA Q&A Process Review
- Student questions and fill-in-the-blank stuff during lecture (interactivity)
