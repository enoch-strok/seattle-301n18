## Week 2

### Yeah!

- jQuery is actually making sense
- Good mix of "stress" and "relief"

### Meh...

- Instructions not always super clear
- Sometimes slightly different from what's in canvas

### Uh ... No.

- Curriculum feels "unorganized"
- Ajax is still feeling pretty WTF by many of you
- Power Hours?

### Thoughts from John and Ray

- Module 1 is a little bit like whiplash. There's some CSS, then 2 days of jQuery, then it's back to CSS and finishes with a deployment.  Remember, that normally takes place over 5 successive days, and sets you up well for the "next week"
- The intent is to drive the core skills that you can use for the next 8 classes
- Start forming habits on sussing out what's in the lab instructions
  - Especially as we get into City Explorer and Book App
