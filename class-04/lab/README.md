# Your Portfolio!

This lab features a working web server containing a portfolio website for you to alter.  In order to get this working, follow these steps:

1. Create a new, empty repository, called `portfolio`
   - Initialize it with a `.gitignore` for `Node`
   - Do not initialize it with a README
1. Clone that to your machine
1. Copy the **contents of this folder** into your repo
   - Not the `lab` folders itself, but these actual files
1. Run the command `npm install`
1. Run the command `npm start`
1. Open your browser to: <http://localhost:3000>

Following those steps, you should see an empty portfolio. Now, you may commence working on the actual lab assignment.

The folders containing the porfolio code for you to edit and modify can be found in the `public` folder herein
